# PoC Steps:
1. The initial service architecture and component layout were drafted. I formulated and submitted questions to clarify unclear aspects from the original request. Started sketching out device interaction logic.
2. Completed the device interaction sketches. Documented how to run them so they can be tested with real devices on-site. Received critical feedback on the initial architecture and partial answers to the submitted questions.
3. Began implementing the service code. Integrated REST/gRPC APIs and embedded the device interaction sketches. Also received initial test results from the previous day's sketches.
4. Applied fixes based on feedback. The first functional version of the service is complete and shared, along with brief run instructions.
5. Prepared the service for a wider range of devices and operating systems. Sent a new version for testing. Meanwhile, writing more automated tests and extending documentation. Requested deployment across all available devices.
6. Identified which devices have issues. Improved service startup flow, added scripts for process monitoring, automatic restarts and seamless updates. Ran tests, collected logs from real devices, implemented fixes and shared an updated version.
7. The service is now running on all devices. Final round of testing is in progress. We're executing full demo cycles as many times as possible, collecting logs again, applying final tweaks if needed and verifying update functionality
